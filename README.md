# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game known for its simplicity and strategic depth. This project aims to provide a simple implementation of the game in Python using the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface.

## Features

- Interactive graphical user interface.
- Two-player gameplay.
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
- End-game detection for a tie.
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and customization.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script `tic_tac_toe.py` to start the game.
2. **Make a Move**: Click on any empty cell in the grid to place your symbol (X or O). Players take turns making moves.
3. **Win the Game**: The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. **End in a Tie**: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for game logic.
- tkinter: Python library used for creating the graphical user interface.
